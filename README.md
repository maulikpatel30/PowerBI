This is the first time using Power BI. It was fun to explore and build something for the first time!

1. Connected Database with Power BI Desktop.
2. Going through the tables thoroughly and finding errors.
3. Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor with DAX.
4. Developing an interactive BI dashboard with data.
